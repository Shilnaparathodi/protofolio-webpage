        <h2>Self Introduction & Achievements</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Shilna P, a first-year student from the IT department. I am from Malappuram. I am an enthusiast with a strong curiosity to learn everything about technology and the world of IT. I believe in gaining experience through participation, so I actively seek to attend every program and event I can. Whether it's workshops, seminars, or hackathons, I aim to learn new things and grow my skills through each experience.</p>

        <h3>Achievements</h3>

            <li>Currently pursuing my first year in the IT department at [Your College Name]</li>
            <li>Participated in various online coding challenges and workshops to build my skills</li>

        <h3>Previous Experience</h3>
        <p>Although I am still in my first year, I have already taken initiative by engaging in online learning platforms and personal projects. I am excited to continue exploring web development, programming, and other areas of technology to build hands-on experience in real-world projects in the future.</p>

        <h3>My Project: pase with ease</h3>
        <p>As part of my learning journey, I developed a web app called <strong>Ease with Pace</strong>, a platform for selling and renting books. The goal of the app is to provide an easy and convenient way for users to buy and rent books. This project allowed me to apply what I learned in web development and get practical experience in building an application.</p>

        <h2>Why Join Women in Tech?</h2>
        <p>I am passionate about joining the Women in Tech team because I believe diversity in the tech industry is essential for driving innovation. A supportive community of women in tech can help overcome challenges and provide opportunities for growth. Being a part of this community will allow me to learn from others and contribute to creating more opportunities for women in the field.</p>
        
        <h3>How I Plan to Contribute</h3>
        <p>Through the Women in Tech team, I plan to contribute by helping organize workshops and mentorship programs for young girls interested in tech. I want to actively promote initiatives that help women improve their technical skills and encourage more women to join the tech industry. I also hope to work towards closing the gender gap in technology by advocating for inclusivity and equal opportunities.</p>

        <h2>My Passion for Women in Tech</h2>
        <p>I am deeply passionate about joining the Women in Tech team because I firmly believe that diversity and inclusion are essential drivers of innovation and progress. As technology continues to shape our world, it's crucial that we create spaces where people of all genders can collaborate, learn, and grow together. I am excited to contribute by organizing hackathons and interactive talk sessions that encourage individuals, particularly women, to share their ideas, showcase their talents, and gain inspiration from accomplished leaders in the tech industry. These events will serve as a platform to elevate underrepresented voices in tech, providing them with valuable opportunities to network, gain new skills, and work alongside like-minded individuals in a collaborative environment.</p>

        <p>I am also committed to creating a space where both women and men can come together, contribute their unique perspectives, and foster a sense of mutual respect and collaboration. Gender diversity in tech is not about creating separate spaces, but rather about building an inclusive community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. By hosting inspirational sessions with industry leaders, I aim to help individuals from all backgrounds recognize the potential they have within the tech field, regardless of gender. I believe that by promoting these kinds of initiatives, we can break down barriers, empower more women to pursue careers in technology, and build a stronger, more creative tech industry that reflects the diverse world we live in. Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to a culture where everyone—regardless of gender—feels welcomed, supported, and inspired to contribute their ideas and drive meaningful change in the tech industry.</p>
